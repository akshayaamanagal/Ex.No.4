### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222230009

### Aim: 
To write the prompt for the following prompt types and ompare that with differenet AI tools and evaluate that using any one evaluation method (eg. Rubrics). 

1. Comparative Analysis Prompt 

2. Experiential Perspective Prompt
   
3. Everyday Functioning Prompts
   
4. Universal Prompt Structures Prompt Refinements
   
5. Prompt Size Limitations design an AI 

### Explanation:
Any one use case from Unit 5 and write the prompt for that with the unit 2 Prompt types given above.


### Scenario and Objectives:

### Scenario: 
The manufacturing industry seeks to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation using IoT devices 
and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.

### Objectives:

• Improve production efficiency by 30%

• Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance

• Enable real-time monitoring and remote control

• Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes

Target Audience: Manufacturing companies in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing.

### Procedure
1. Define the scenario and objectives.
2. Identify prompt types based on the assignment requirement.
3. Write one prompt for each type tailored to the scenario.
4. Run the prompts on ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot to compare responses.
5. Evaluate each prompt using a rubric on clarity, relevance, actionability, and scalability.

### Results – Outputs from Different AI Tools

#### Prompt 1 – Comparative Analysis

ChatGPT: IoT-based predictive maintenance uses real-time sensor data to predict failures, reducing downtime and costs. Traditional scheduled maintenance follows fixed intervals regardless of actual equipment condition. IoT is more efficient but requires upfront investment.

Gemini: Predictive maintenance leverages connected sensors and analytics to anticipate issues before they occur. Scheduled maintenance is simpler but often wastes time and resources. IoT offers higher uptime but adds complexity.

Copilot: Predictive maintenance – data driven, reduces downtime. Scheduled maintenance – time based, easier but less efficient. IoT approach saves cost long-term.

#### Prompt 2 – Experiential Perspective

ChatGPT: I now rely on dashboards instead of manual inspections. Real-time alerts help me plan maintenance, reduce unexpected stoppages and optimise staff deployment.

Gemini: Before IoT I walked the floor with checklists; now automated systems send me performance reports and predictive alerts on my phone, making my work faster and less stressful.

Copilot: Automation gives me instant status updates, fewer manual checks and better efficiency.

#### Prompt 3 – Everyday Functioning

ChatGPT: Both use sensors and connectivity. In factories, machines adjust automatically; in homes, thermostats and lights adjust usage to save energy.

Gemini: Just like smart homes learn your habits to reduce electricity, IoT in factories learns machine behaviour to optimise production.

Copilot: Similar: sensors + automation control energy and performance in both settings.

#### Prompt 4 – Universal Prompt Structure

ChatGPT: Sensors on machines measure vibration, temperature, etc. Data is sent to a cloud system which analyses it and warns engineers before a breakdown. Example: a motor sends vibration data to predict bearing wear.

Gemini: Machines have sensors that gather readings, transmit them to a server, and software predicts failures. For instance, conveyor belts reporting speed anomalies.

Copilot: Sensors collect data → cloud analyses → alerts when maintenance needed. Example: temperature sensors on a boiler.

#### Prompt 5 – Prompt Size Limitation / Refinement

ChatGPT: Gave 5 items first (sensors, edge devices, cloud analytics, predictive software, wireless networks) then, after my next prompt, continued with next 5 until 20.

Gemini: Listed all 20 at once grouped under headings.

Copilot: Produced 10 items at once, then required another prompt for the rest.

### Observations

• ChatGPT produced the most structured, step-by-step and role-based answers.

• Gemini gave slightly longer, story-like answers and sometimes tried to complete the whole request at once.

• Copilot’s answers were brief and bulleted but needed follow-up prompts for large lists.

### Result: 
The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
